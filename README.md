Group 2 - Jobster: the Job application tracker<br><br>
Link to live deployed app: https://jobster-group-2.herokuapp.com/aboutus

## Purpose
It can really be a pain to track all of your job applications, and we aim to alleviate this problem.  <br><br>
We have created a web app where, once signed up and logged in, users can track all of their applications in one place by submitting the appropriate information in our forms.  Just imagine not having to stress yourself over remembering details of each application!
<br><br>
Not only can users track all of their applications, but we also give the ability to upload resumes and cover letters.  Essentially a one stop shop to keep all job app related materials! 
<br>

## Assignment
With your team, you’ll conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem. In creating your first collaborative full-stack application, you’ll combine a robust back end--with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authentication—-to an intuitive front end. You’ll continue to build on the agile development methodologies you’ve used throughout this course, like storing your project code in GitHub, managing your work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

Instead of using the front end you developed for your first project, you should start from scratch. Doing so will help you reinforce your existing front-end abilities and solidify your understanding of the dynamic between the front end and back end. Also, you’ve likely improved your skills since that first project, so with a stronger foundation now you can build a better application, using all of the additional practice you’ve had in the last several weeks.

## Technologies Used
This project was created and deployed using JavaScript, node.js (and associated packages), HTML, CSS, Handlebars, mySQL, Multer, Cloudinary, Figma, Dbdiagram.io, and Heroku.
